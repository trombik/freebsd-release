loader.conf* files are managed by freebsd-release Makefile, found at

https://github.com/trombik/freebsd-release

local modification to loader.conf* on pxeboot server is over-written by "make
upload". modify loader.conf* in the repository if permanent change is required..

hardware-specific hints are _required_ to enable serial console during
installation:

# cd /path/to/FTP/dir
# cd boot
# ln -s loader.conf.$ADDITIONAL_FILE loader.conf.local

if the file system doesn't support symlink (msdosfs)

# cp loader.conf.$ADDITIONAL_FILE loader.conf.local
